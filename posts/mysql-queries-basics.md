## Tables and Keys in RDBMS

- It have rows and columns.
- We have a **primary key** which helps in uniquely identifying a specific row in database.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Student id (p)</th>
    <th>name</th>
    <th>major</th>
    <th>Branch id (f)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Jayesh</td>
    <td>Mathematics</td>
    <td>11</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Jay</td>
    <td>Biology</td>
    <td>12</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Jayesh</td>
    <td>Mathematics</td>
    <td>11</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Here both Jayesh are different and can be identified by student id (primary key).

- Here, student id is a **Surrogate Key** and a surrogate key is basically a key that has no mapping to anything in the real world. Just random number.
- We can also use **Natural Keys** instead of surrogate keys. A natural key is a key that has significance in real world. For example :- SSN(social security number), our own roll number 19T5030 as it gives so much info about my academics.
- Another key is **Foreign Keys.** And a foreign key is an attribute that we can store on a database table that will link us to another database table. Here Branch can work as a foreign key.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Branch</th>
    <th>Strength</th>
    <th>Class Teacher</th>
    <th>Branch id</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>E&TC</td>
    <td>78</td>
    <td>John</td>
    <td>11</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CSE</td>
    <td>72</td>
    <td>Kate</td>
    <td>12</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Here branch id is linking us to another table

- Foreign Keys can also be used to define relationship in same table. Example :- In a database of employees, some employees can be the manager of others.
- Primary key can also consists of more than one columns, and this is what we would call **Composite keys.** A composite key is a key that needs two attribute.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Branch</th>
    <th>Teacher</th>
    <th>Subject</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>11</td>
    <td>John</td>
    <td>Java</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>11</td>
    <td>Kate</td>
    <td>C++</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>12</td>
    <td>Kate</td>
    <td>C++</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Here branch id and teacher both works as primary key i.e. they together are composite key.

    Foreign key
    
    Composite key

### Queries

- A query is a set of instructions given to the RDBMS (written in SQL) that tell the RDBMS what information you want it to retrieve for you.
    - Tons of data in database.
    - Often hidden in a complex schema.
    - Goal is to only get the data you need.

```sql
SELECT employee.name, employee.age
FROM employee
WHERE employee.salary > 3000;
```

<div id="creating-tables"></div>

## Creating Tables

Datatypes :

```sql
INT -- Whole Numbers
DECIMAL(M,N) -- Decimal Numbers with M total digits, N digits after decimal
VARCHAR(l) -- String of text of length l
BLOB -- Binary Large Object, Stores large data
DATE -- 'YYYY-MM-DD'
TIMESTAMP -- 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
```

Let's create a table -

```sql
CREATE TABLE student (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(20),
    major VARCHAR(20)
);

or

CREATE TABLE student (
    student_id INT,
    name VARCHAR(20),
    major VARCHAR(20),
		PRIMARY KEY(student_id)
);
```

This will create -

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>student_id (p)</th>
    <th>name</th>
    <th>major</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>
- To see table -

```sql
DESCRIBE student;
```
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Field</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Null</th>
    <th>Key</th>
    <th>Default</th>
    <th>Extra</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>student_id</td>
    <td>int(11)</td>
    <td>NO</td>
    <td>PRI</td>
    <td>NULL</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>name</td>
    <td>varchar(20)</td>
    <td>YES</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>NULL</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>major</td>
    <td>varchar(20)</td>
    <td>YES</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>NULL</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>

- To Delete Table -

```sql
DROP TABLE student;
```

- Add a column to the Table -

```sql
ALTER TABLE student ADD gpa DECIMAL(4,2);
```

- Delete a column of the Table -

```sql
ALTER TABLE student DROP COLUMN gpa;
```

<div id="inserting-data-in-table"></div>

## Inserting Data in Table -

```sql
INSERT INTO student VALUES(
    1, 'Jack', 'Biology'
);
```

- See Table values -

```sql
SELECT * FROM student;
```

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>student_id (p)</th>
    <th>name</th>
    <th>major</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Jack</td>
    <td>Biology</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>
- What if we have some blank values -

```sql
INSERT INTO student(student_id, name) VALUES(2, 'Kate');
```

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>student_id (p)</th>
    <th>name</th>
    <th>major</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Jack</td>
    <td>Biology</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Kate</td>
    <td>NULL</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<div id="constrains"></div>

## Constrains -

- Make fields Required -

```sql
CREATE TABLE student (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- NOT NULL
    major VARCHAR(20)
);
```

- Make fields Unique -

```sql
CREATE TABLE student (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE,  -- UNIQUE
    major VARCHAR(20)
);
```

- PRIMARY KEY is NOT NULL and UNIQUE by default.
- We want to set a default value -

```sql
CREATE TABLE student (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(20),
    major VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'undecided'   -- default string value undecided
);
```

- We are increasing PRIMARY KEY on each entry, we can also make db do that -

```sql
CREATE TABLE student (
    student_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT, -- Now we don't need to enter id
    name VARCHAR(20),
    major VARCHAR(20),
		PRIMARY KEY(student_id)
)
```

<div id="update-and-delete"></div>

## Update and Delete -

- What if we want to change some information from database -

```sql
UPDATE student
SET major = 'Bio'
WHERE major = 'Biology';
-- this will change all Biology major fields to Bio
```

- Other comparison operations -

| = | equal |

| <> | not equal |

| > | greater than |

| < | less than |

| >= | greater than or equal  |

| <= | less than or equal |


```sql
UPDATE student
SET major = 'Biochemistry'
WHERE major = 'Bio' OR major = 'Chemistry';
-- obvious
```

```sql
UPDATE student
SET name = 'Tom', major = 'undecided'
WHERE student_id = 1;
-- obvious
```

- If we remove WHERE statement, then it will get applied to every column of table -

```sql
UPDATE student
SET major = 'Science';
```

- Delete row from table -

```sql
DELETE FROM student;  -- This will delete all the rows from the table

DELETE FROM student
WHERE student_id = 5;  -- Delete a specific row

DELETE FROM student
WHERE name = 'Tom' AND major = 'Bio';
```

<div id="basic-queries"></div>

## Basic Queries -

Getting information from database.

- Grab all the information -

```sql
SELECT * FROM student;
```

- Grab a column -

```sql
SELECT name FROM student;
```

- Grab multiple columns -

```sql
SELECT name, major FROM student;
or
SELECT student.name, student.major FROM student;
```

- Sort by values -

```sql
SELECT name, major 
FROM student
ORDER BY name;

SELECT name, major 
FROM student
ORDER BY name DESC; -- For descending order && ASC for ascending

SELECT name, major 
FROM student
ORDER BY student_id;  -- even though we are not selecting id we can order by it

SELECT name, major 
FROM student
ORDER BY major, student_id;  -- first sort by major then student_id
```

- Limit number of result -

```sql
SELECT *
FROM student
LIMIT 2;  -- gonna show only two result
```

- Filtering -

```sql
SELECT *
FROM student
WHERE major = 'Chemistry';  -- fiter

SELECT *
FROM student
WHERE major = 'Chemistry' OR major = 'Biology';  -- fiter

-- We can use a bunch of comparison operators in WHERE
-- <, >, <=, >=, <>

SELECT *
FROM student
WHERE name IN ('Claire', 'Kate', 'Mike');  -- domains

-- we can always combine all the queries
```

- Some basic queries -

```sql
-- find all employees
SELECT * FROM employee;

-- find all clients
SELECT * FROM client;

-- find all employees salary sorted
SELECT * 
FROM employee
ORDER BY salary DESC;

-- find all employees order by sex then name
SELECT *
FROM employee
ORDER BY sex, first_name, last_name;

-- find the first 5 employees in table
SELECT *
FROM employee
LIMIT 5;

-- find the first and last name of all employees
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employee;

-- find the forename and surname of all employees
SELECT first_name AS forename, last_name as surname
FROM employee;

-- find out all the different gender
SELECT DISTINCT sex
FROM employee;
```

<div id="sql-functions"></div>

## SQL Functions -

```sql
-- find the number of employees
SELECT COUNT(emp_id)
FROM employee;

-- find the number of female employees born after 1970
SELECT COUNT(emp_id)
FROM employee
WHERE sex = 'F' AND birth_day >= '1971-01-01';

-- find the average of all employee salary
SELECT AVG(salary)
FROM employee;

-- find the sum of all employee salary
SELECT SUM(salary)
FROM employee;

-- find how many males and females are there
SELECT COUNT(sex), sex
FROM employee
GROUP BY sex;

-- find the total sales of each salesman
SELECT SUM(total_sales), emp_id
FROM works_with
GROUP BY emp_id;
```

<div id="wildcard"></div>

## Wildcard -

```sql
-- % = any # characters, _ = one character

-- find any client's who are an LLC
SELECT *
FROM client
WHERE client_name LIKE '%LLC';  -- if client_name looks like this, 
-- % here indicates that any character can come before that but it ends with LLC.

-- find any branch suppliers who are in label business
SELECT *
FROM branch_supplier
WHERE supplier_name LIKE '%Label%';

-- find any employee born in october
SELECT *
FROM employee
WHERE birth_day Like '____-10%';

-- find any clients who are schools
SELECT *
FROM client
WHERE client_name LIKE '%school%';
```

<div id="unions"></div>

## Unions -

Union is a basic SQL operator used to combine the results of multiple SELECT statements into one.

Rules of using UNION -

- Should have same number of columns in each queries.
- Should also have similar data types.

```sql
-- find a list of employee and branch names
SELECT first_name
FROM employee
UNION
SELECT branch_name
FROM branch
UNION 
SELECT client_name
FROM client;

-- find a list of all clients & branch suppliers' names
SELECT client_name, branch_id
FROM client
UNION
SELECT supplier_name, branch_id
FROM branch_supplier;

-- find the list of all the money spent or earned by the company
SELECT salary
FROM employee
UNION
SELECT total_sale
FROM works_with;
```

<div id="join"></div>

## JOIN -

JOIN are used to combine rows of two or more tables based on a related column between them -

```sql
-- find all branches and name of their managers
SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, branch.branch_name
FROM employee
JOIN branch
ON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id;
```

Types of joins -

- Inner JOIN - Inner JOIN(simply JOIN) combines the rows from two table whenever they have shared column in common.
- LEFT JOIN - Includes all the rows from the left table (FROM statement one).
- RIGHT JOIN - Includes all the rows from the right table
- Full OUTER JOIN - Combination of LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN.

<div id="nested-queries"></div>

## Nested Queries -

```sql
-- find name of all employees who have
-- sold over 30,000 to a single client
SELECT employees.first_name, employees.last_name
FROM employee
WHERE employee.emp_id IN(
	SELECT works_with.emp_id
	FROM works_with
	WHERE works_with.total_sales > 30000;
)

-- find all clients who are handled by the branch
-- that Micheal Scott manages
-- assume that you know Micheal's ID
SELECT client_name
FROM client
WHERE branch_id IN(
	SELECT branch_id
	FROM branch
	WHERE mgr_id = 102
);
```
<div id="on-delete"></div>

## ON DELETE -

- ON DELETE SET NULL -

```sql
CREATE TABLE branch (
	branch_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	branch_name VARCHAR(40),
	mgr_id INT,
	mgr_start_date DATE,
	FOREIGN KEY(mgr_id) REFERENCES employee(emp_id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);

-- here mgr_id will becomes NULL when emp_id is deleted

CREATE TABLE branch (
	branch_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	branch_name VARCHAR(40),
	mgr_id INT,
	mgr_start_date DATE,
	FOREIGN KEY(mgr_id) REFERENCES employee(emp_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- here mgr_id wil get deleted when emp_id is deleted
```

<div id="trigger"></div>

## Triggers -

Trigger is a block of SQL code which will define a certain action when a certain operation gets performed on the database.

```sql
DELIMETER $$
CREATE
	TRIGGER my_trigger BEFORE INSERT
	ON employee
	FOR EACH ROW BEGIN
		INSERT INTO trigger_test VALUES('added new employee');
	END$$
DELIMETER ;
-- here we are changing delimeter to $$ sign then back to ;
-- Whenever a new value is inserted into employee table
-- 'added new employee' is added into trigger_test table

DELIMETER $$
CREATE
	TRIGGER my_trigger BEFORE INSERT
	ON employee
	FOR EACH ROW BEGIN
		INSERT INTO trigger_test VALUES(NEW.first_name);
	END$$
DELIMETER ;

-- this one will add first_name value of new entry in trigger_test

-- Complex trigger
DELIMETER $$
CREATE
	TRIGGER my_trigger BEFORE INSERT
	ON employee
	FOR EACH ROW BEGIN
		IF NEW.sex = 'M' THEN
			INSERT INTO trigger_test VALUES('added male employee')
		ELSEIF NEW.sex = 'F' THEN
			INSERT INTO trigger_test VALUES('added female employee')
		ELSE 
			INSERT INTO trigger_test VALUES('added other employee')
		END IF;
	END$$
DELIMITER ;
-- functioning obvious

-- Delete a trigger
DROP TRIGGER my_trigger;
```
