## Variables (new)

--var family_name: Dursley

When Mr and Mrs {{family_name}} woke up on the dull, grey Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr {{family_name}} hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and Mrs {{family_name}} gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.

## What is Markdown?
Markdown (MD) is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML. If you would like to see the cheatsheet for writing MD just click [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
